# FanficReadeR
*A webscraper for gathering public data on AO3*

Fanfiction is an interesting consumer area. You have a set of people who love a work so much that they dedicate countless hours of their time to creating their own stories inside the world of the story. There is little material gain for writing fanfic; authors are paid very little for their time (if at all), and writing a fanfic can sometimes feel like screaming one's thoughts into the void.

Yet fanfiction has also been the engine behind a number of pop culture mega-hits. Fifty Shades of Gray? [Started with a Twilight Fanfic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2017/02/10/fifty-shades-of-green-how-fanfiction-went-from-dirty-little-secret-to-money-machine/?sh=1886f89d264c). City of Bones (the book series) & Shadowhunters (the Netflix series)? [Started with a Harry Potter Fanfic](https://theweek.com/articles/460833/girls-film-confounding-problems-fan-fiction). More original content that is posted on fanfiction sites like Wattpad have [also led to Netflix TV series](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/14/netflixs-latest-hit-the-kissing-booth-is-a-wattpad-success-story/).

It's not an exaggeration to say that media juggernauts like the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling owe a lot to the content their fans have generated; The over 800,000 HP Fanfics on one website, AO3, have certainly contributed to the maintenance of a passionate fanbase.

This is all to say that understanding the dynamics of fanfiction communities is important for understanding modern media. I've made what I hope is a useful
tool for researchers and enthusiasts to easily get data about fanfiction communities.

## The Package
`FanficReadeR` scrapes data from [ArchiveOfOurOwn](http://archiveofourown.org) (AO3), one of the world's leading fanfiction websites, with more than 3.7 million registered users and 7.6 million works listed on the platform. This package gathers data about two broad categories: **Users** and **Works**

### Works
Works are simply stories writting by users. They come in a variety of formats:
* One-Shots - short stories that typically have only 1 chapter
* Epics - the current [longest-fanfic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7899862) is over 5 million words
* Joke Fics - the current [most-liked fic on AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2080878) is one that simply repeats "I am Groot" over and over again.

Works can also be organized into **series**, or collections of individual fanfics to tell some broader story or to explore similar themes. Some users, for example, may write a series of Harry Potter fanfictions that follow a similar structure as the 7-book original series.

There are also a series of metrics by which to evaluate works:
* Length: defined as either chapter-count or word-count
* Kudos: the AO3 equivalent of "likes"
* Comments: responses to the fic generated by readers (with timestamps)
* Bookmarks: the number of times a fic has been "saved" by a reader to display on their profile
* Pairings: denotes the romantic/sexual pairings of characters in the story (F/F, F/M, M/M, Multi, etc)
* Fandoms: lists all the fandoms a work is associated with. This is important because many fics are "crossovers", using intellectual property from multiple different story universes (e.g.: a Harry Potter/Twilight crossover might have Bella attending Hogwarts)
* Completion Status: Some fanfictions are completed, others are works in progress, others are simply abandoned. Some users refuse to read incomplete works, as WIPs or abandoned fics sometimes stop just before a key plot point is resolved, leading to an unsatisfactory experience.
* Language: what language is the story written in?
* Characters: what characters are involved in this story? Who do they "pair off" with?

### Users
There are a number of features about users that may prove interesting to an external observer.

* Bookmarks: a list of all the fics a user has saved for later, or wishes to recommend to others
* Works: a list of all the stories the author has written or is in the process of writing
* Biography: a set of user characteristics like join date, user ID, name, and any pseudonyms they may have

### Functions
`FanficReadeR` uses a small set of functions to generate this data about individual works and/or authors.
